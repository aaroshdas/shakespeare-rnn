a reccurent neural network that is trained on shakespeare to generate english
<br/>

shakespeare-generate.py : generates text
<br/>
shakespeare-rnn.py : trains
<br/>

there is likely some small mathematical error somewhere that I am unable to find that causes the model to start overtraining at around 1.3 million points, so the model
generates english best at around 1.2 million (although far from perfect) with a temprature of 0.7
